# Participation Procedure and Contribution Rules

## Overview
**App Ninja Kit** is an open-source project where everyone is welcome to contribute. Contributions are unpaid, and your reward is the recognition of your work, which will be publicly visible on GitHub. This file outlines the procedures and rules for contributing to the project.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Everyone is Welcome**  
   Anyone can contribute, regardless of their experience level. Your contribution is valuable, and you will receive public credit for your work on GitHub.

2. **Create a New Branch**  
   Before working on any task, you must create a new branch for your work. This helps us keep the main codebase stable and makes reviewing contributions easier.

   The naming convention for branches is as follows:
   - **feature/**: For new features or enhancements (e.g., `feature/add-login-system`)
   - **bug/**: For bug fixes (e.g., `bug/fix-login-error`)
   - **security/**: For security improvements (e.g., `security/encrypt-local-storage`)

3. **Before Submitting a PR**  
   Before submitting a Pull Request (PR), ensure the following steps have been completed:
   - **Test the App**:  
     - Run tests in development and production environments.
     - Test the build of the application to ensure it functions correctly.
   - **Run Code Quality Checks**:  
     Execute the following commands to maintain consistent code quality:
     - `npm run format` – Ensures code follows the project's formatting guidelines.
     - `npm run lint` – Identifies and fixes potential code quality issues.
     - `npm run typecheck` – Verifies type safety in the codebase.
   - **Documentation**:  
     Include clear documentation of the changes, explaining the feature or fix.
   - **Testing**:  
     Add appropriate unit tests and End-to-End (E2E) tests (when applicable) for the changes.
   - **Testing Instructions**:  
     Provide instructions on how the feature or fix was tested, including the necessary steps to reproduce the results.

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   Once your work is complete, submit a PR from your branch. PRs will be reviewed by the contributor leaders. Make sure the PR contains all the necessary information and passes all required checks.

5. **Road Map Compliance**  
   We are focused on achieving our project goals, so only features or fixes related to the current [Road Map](./ROADMAP.md) will be accepted. Please review the Road Map before starting a new feature to ensure your contribution aligns with the project’s goals.
